## Accessibility and Code Complexity

The project maintainer has ADHD, which impacts working memory. When presenting information or making code changes:

### Information Presentation
- Present information in small, digestible chunks
- Minimize complexity in explanations and code structure
- Use clear, descriptive names that reduce cognitive load

### Code Structure
- Keep functions simple with cyclomatic complexity less than 7
- Break down complex tasks into smaller, focused functions
- Avoid deeply nested logic structures

### Documentation and Communication
When presenting code diffs or changes, always include a bulleted list below the diff summarizing the specific changes made. This helps with code review and understanding the scope of modifications.
